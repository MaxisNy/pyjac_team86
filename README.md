# PixelPirates - PyJac Team 86
## Short Introduction
Hello! Our names are Adam, Maxim, and Shrivardhan. This game is our hackathon submission!
## What is Pixel Pirates?
### How?
Pixel Pirates is a game we created using Python's popular pygame library. Additionally, the project was coded using seperated classes in attempt to avoid tight coupling and practice good software design.
### What?
Captain LackBeard has encountered two powerful enemy ships. The ships are loaded with cannonball projectiles and are trying to destroy his greatest treasure, his ship, "The Booty Hauler". 
### Why?
We were inspired by the popular games of our childhood! We really wanted to let players feel a sense of nostalgia.
